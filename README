# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## Introduction
This project was completed as part of my **Data Science (CSE437)** course. It aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions by implementing existing machine learning models.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains online payment-related transactional data, accessible via Kaggle. It includes:
- **Rows**: 129,667 transactions, each representing a unique transaction.
- **Columns**: Details about the client, transaction amount, payment method, and whether the transaction was fraudulent.
- **Privacy**: All data is anonymized to ensure privacy and security.
